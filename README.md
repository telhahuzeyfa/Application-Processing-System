## Project Pitch
<blockquote>
HT College application processing system and an admission review system allows graduate applicants process admissions applications, seeking admission to Masters program at HT College. By going to the website graduate applicants are able to start an application by creating an account and entering their personal information and their academic history that are needed to apply for the program into the database. After applicants go through the MS program application process their application is sent to the faculty reviewers, Chair of admissions committee and Graduate Secretary of HT College. The system allows applicants to check for the status of their application after sending their application.

## Viewing Decisions from CAC/Chair
<img src="https://recordit.co/RvLIXoJaQ3.gif" width=500><br>

<blockquote>
Different faculty members, for example, have different responsibilities. Faculty Reviewers are responsible for reviewing applicants' forms and records, such as transcripts, recommendation letters, and other relevant details, and providing input to the Graduate Secretary. Admissions committee chairs perform similar duties to faculty reviewers, with the exception of the ability to admit or reject applicants. Finally, the Graduate Secretary has complete access to an applicant's data, including reviews/decisions taken by both faculty reviewers and admissions committee chairs, and will make the final decision after thoroughly evaluating the applicant's data. Applicants are informed of the status of their applications after the final decision is made by either the Graduate Secretary or by the chair of the admissions committee.

## DB Schema
<blockquote>
My database contains correct field types to make validation simpler and store accessible datas by storing information like application forms, decisions, review forms, and admission forms in various tables and linking them to store, manipulate, and retrieve data that is stored in tables made up of rows and columns. Each table has a column with its own data type, such as an integer, a string of characters (for text), or decimal numbers. Each row of the tables contains a value for each column, as shown in the schema below, which contains a unique value that is  used to uniquely identify each row of a table.

Different primary keys are used in the database to outline a particular task in order to efficiently use each key to help optimize the database. It also adheres to normalization dependencies to prevent duplication and make data storage and retrieval as simple as possible.
